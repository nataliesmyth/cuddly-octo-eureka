More specifically, your generous support helps YES! compensate our administrative staff, workshop facilitators, podcast hosts, editors, and guests, as well as cover a host of other expenditures that make it possible for YES! to expand participants' understanding of sexuality and provide them with tools to be more communicative, respectful, and safe.</p>
